\
This is an intro of my study about backend stuff.\
**Feel free to explore!!**

## 📁 What does this directory contain?
* Basic
  * Content
  * Practical Work

## 🔗 [Basic] Backend Basic Practice
### Goal
* Create two works using multiple infrastructure elements
  * Non-disruptive automated deployment system\
    (무중단 자동화 배포 시스템)
  * Reliable, fast backend system\
    (신뢰성 있고 빠른 백엔드 시스템)
* Learn various techniques
  * Construct scale-out and non-disruptive deployment systems with Nginx\
    (**Nginx**를 통한 scale-out과 무중단 배포 시스템 구축)
  * Automate deployments by Git, Jenkins for practical work\
    (실무를 위한 **Git, Jenkins**로 배포 자동화)
  * Save the request by RabbitMQ and process it according to the server resources\
    (**Message Query**)
  * Search more faster than DB by using **Elasticsearch**, a search engine
### Good to learn these
* Spring framework-based server development experience
* Operating Linux environment
* Experience how to operate and improve the architecture design and structure of large-capacity server systems
* Linking database and cache (Redis, memcached, MySQL, etc.)
* Introducing and linking MQ, Kafka, Elastic Search, etc.

### Prologue
* How does people use Git in practice? (not only commit/push)
* How can I upload the changed code on the server? I can't get a request while the server pops up..
* Is there a suitable storage for searching other than DB? I implemented searching with DB's LIKE, but it got too slow as the data piled up..
* How can I test how much traffic I can get after I put the application I made on the server?
* I want to put my services on Cloud services like AWS and GCP, how do I configure them?

### Need to Know
* How to test and improve the performance of an application\
  (애플리케이션의 성능을 테스트하고, 개선하는 법)
  * Start of performance tuning
* How to distribute servers and withstand high traffic\
  (서버를 분산시키고, 많은 트래픽을 견뎌내는 법)
  * Make a server using **Nginx & Jenkins**
    * Make a system that can deploy new versions without disruption and recieve a lot of traffic by Nginx **load balancing & scale out**
      > load balancing: 서버가 받는 부하를 여러 서버로 분산하는 것\
      > scale out: 연결된 서버의 수를 늘려서 수평적으로 확장하는 것\
      > scale up: 연결된 서버 자체의 성능을 올리는 것
    * Distribute user's requests to various servers
    * Automated deployments by Jenkins
* How to use Git for effective collaboration in practice\
  (실무에서 협업을 잘하고 싶을 때 쓰는 Git 사용법)
  * Branch strategies and frequently used Git functions in collaborative environments where multiple people develop the same project
* How to design a system capable of handling large-scale traffic\
  (대규모 트래픽을 처리할 수 있는 시스템 구성 방법)
  * After load balancing by Nginx, save the request in RabbitMQ and process as much as the resources allow
  * Process a lot more traffics than simply connecting the server and the database 1:1
  * Use Elasticsearch(ES, search engine) to search a lot more faster
